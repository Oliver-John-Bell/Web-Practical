There is an app within the practical django project for each practical work.
This can be navigated to by /practical<>/...
Developer/Debug mode is still enabled and will show what urls are avilable in each practical.
The main url.py file imports the urls stored in each of the practical apps.
The only critical point that could cause issues between apps would be the shared database.
